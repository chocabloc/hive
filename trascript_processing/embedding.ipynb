Zuckerberg teams up with Eduardo Saverin to launch the platform, navigating both rapid success and personal conflicts. As Facebook grows, legal battles arise, including lawsuits from the Winklevoss twins who claim he stole their idea. The movie explores themes of ambition, friendship, betrayal, and the complex origins of one of the world’s most influential social networks.\",\n","    \"Building successful startups begins with identifying a real problem and crafting a product or service that effectively addresses it. Strong teams with complementary skills and shared vision are critical to navigating challenges and executing ideas efficiently. Securing adequate funding and managing resources wisely ensures the startup can scale and survive early-stage uncertainties. Continuous learning, adaptability, and focusing on customer feedback help maintain growth and long-term success in a competitive market.\",\n","    \"Swiss cheese is a type of cheese originating from Switzerland, known for its distinctive pale yellow color and characteristic holes, or “eyes.” It is made from cow’s milk and is typically mild, slightly nutty, and sweet in flavor. The holes form naturally during the fermentation process when bacteria release carbon dioxide, creating bubbles in the cheese. Swiss cheese is widely used in sandwiches, fondues, and cooking due to its smooth texture and meltability.\",\n","    \"I tried to teach my cat to fetch, but apparently, she prefers to watch me run instead.
